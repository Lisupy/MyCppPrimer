President Trump announced on Friday his decision to disavow the Iran nuclear agreement, threatening to leave the deal altogether if it was not amended to permanently block Tehran from building nuclear weapons or intercontinental missiles.
But even as he delivered a fire-breathing indictment of the Iranian government¡¯s activities around the Middle East, he stopped short of unraveling the agreement reached by President Barack Obama two years ago.
¡°We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more chaos, the very real threat of Iran¡¯s nuclear breakout,¡± Mr. Trump declared at the White House in a speech that was intended to define a broad strategy for confronting Iran.
